# PostgreSQL 10 High Performance
This is the code repository for [PostgreSQL 10 High Performance](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/postgresql-10-high-performance?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788474481), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
VirtuPostgreSQL database servers have a common set of problems that they encounter as their usage gets heavier and requirements get more demanding. Peek into the future of your PostgreSQL 10 database's problems today. Know the warning signs to look for and how to avoid the most common issues before they even happen.

Surprisingly, most PostgreSQL database applications evolve in the same wayâ€”choose the right hardware, tune the operating system and server memory use, optimize queries against the database and CPUs with the right indexes, and monitor every layer, from hardware to queries, using tools from inside and outside PostgreSQL. Also, using monitoring insight, PostgreSQL database applications continuously rework the design and configuration. On reaching the limits of a single server, they break things up; connection pooling, caching, partitioning, replication, and parallel queries can all help handle increasing database workloads.

By the end of this book, you will have all the knowledge you need to design, run, and manage your PostgreSQL solution while ensuring high performance and high availability

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
for each outer row:
 for each inner row:
 if join condition is true:
 output combined row
```

In order for this book to be useful, you need at least access to a PostgreSQL client that is
allowed to execute queries on a server. Ideally, you'll also be the server administrator. Full
client and server packages for PostgreSQL are available for most popular operating systems
at http://www.postgresql.org/download/. All the examples here are executed on
Command Prompt, usually running the psql program. This makes them applicable to most
platforms. It's straightforward to do many of these operations using a GUI tool for
PostgreSQL instead, such as the pgAdmin program. Some scripts that are written in the
bash scripting language are provided.
